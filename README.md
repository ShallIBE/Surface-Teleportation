The Most important file here so far is Surface.py 
it includes all functions (Stim Circuit Creation not done yet)
The use case shows an example:
The main function to call is surface_data(n,m,c,spacing,display_svg)
Where n,m are dimensions, c is the column at which the cut occurs, spacing is to contol the outlay, and finally display_svg to show a nice map (False by default)
